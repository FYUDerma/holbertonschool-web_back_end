# ES6 Promises

This folder contains projects and exercises related to ES6 Promises, part of the Holberton School curriculum. The goal of these projects is to understand and implement JavaScript promises, which are used to handle asynchronous operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of a promise in JavaScript
- Create and use promises to handle asynchronous operations
- Chain promises for sequential asynchronous operations
- Handle errors in promises

## Project Structure

- **0-promise.js**: A script that returns a promise.
- **1-promise.js**: A script that demonstrates chaining promises.
- **2-promise.js**: A script that handles errors in promises.
- **3-promise.js**: A script that uses `Promise.all` to handle multiple promises.
- **4-promise.js**: A script that uses `Promise.race` to handle multiple promises.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the following command:

```bash
node <script-name>.js
```

For example, to run `0-promise.js`:

```bash
node 0-promise.js
```
