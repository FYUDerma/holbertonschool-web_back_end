# ES6 Promises

This repository contains projects for learning about ES6 Promises as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and implement the following concepts:

- Promises and how they work
- Creating and using Promises
- Chaining Promises
- Handling errors in Promises
- Using `async` and `await` with Promises

## Project Structure

- `0-promise.js`: A script that returns a resolved promise.
- `1-promise.js`: A script that returns a rejected promise.
- `2-then.js`: A script that demonstrates chaining promises using `.then()`.
- `3-catch.js`: A script that demonstrates error handling in promises using `.catch()`.
- `4-resolveReject.js`: A script that demonstrates resolving and rejecting promises.
- `5-asyncAwait.js`: A script that demonstrates using `async` and `await` with promises.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
cd holbertonschool-web_back_end/ES6_promise
```

## Usage

Run the scripts using Node.js:

```bash
node 0-promise.js
node 1-promise.js
node 2-then.js
node 3-catch.js
node 4-resolveReject.js
node 5-asyncAwait.js
```
